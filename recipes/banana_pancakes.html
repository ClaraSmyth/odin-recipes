    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These quick and easy banana pancakes are dairy-free and eggless. They can be ready in just 10 minutes, and wolfed down in one! Perfect for busy mornings.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 bananas, peeled (approx. 160g/5oz peeled weight)</li>
        <li>120g/4½oz plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>120ml/4¼fl oz oat milk (or other plant-based milk)</li>
        <li>3 tsp coconut or vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roughly chop the bananas and add to a blender with the flour, baking powder and oat milk. Blend until smooth. Alternatively, mash the banana thoroughly on a plate, then transfer to a bowl and whisk in the other ingredients until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a teaspoon of the oil in a small frying pan over a medium–high heat and spoon the mixture into the pan to make two pancakes, each about 10cm/4in in diameter – you will need about a tablespoon of mixture per pancake. Cook for around 2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown, adding more oil if needed, then keep warm. Repeat until you have made all the pancakes. </li>
        <li>To serve, divide the pancakes between two plates and top with the banana, blueberries, maple syrup and coconut yoghurt. Enjoy while still warm. </li>
    </ol>
