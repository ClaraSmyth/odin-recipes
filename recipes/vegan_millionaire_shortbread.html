    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vegan millionaire's shortbread is so easy to make with vegan condensed milk for the caramel and a simple biscuit base. It is a super-rich recipe, as the name implies!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the shortbread</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g/7oz vegan butter, plus extra for greasing</li>
        <li>120g/4½oz caster sugar</li>
        <li>250g/9oz plain flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the caramel</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350g/12oz vegan butter</li>
        <li>170g/6oz golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 x 370g tins vegan condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>360g/12½oz vegan dark chocolate</li>
        <li>2 tbsp coconut oil</li>
        <li>pinch sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3. Grease a 20cm/8in non-stick square tin (it works best with a removable base) with vegan butter.</li>
        <li>To make the shortbread, cream the vegan butter and sugar together in a large bowl. Sift in the flour and mix well, until a crumbly texture forms. Tip the mixture into the greased cake tin and spread it out evenly with the back of a spoon. Press the shortbread down firmly with your knuckles so that it is tightly packed in the tin. Pierce the biscuit base with a fork, then bake for 20 minutes or until just golden brown. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>To make the caramel, melt the butter and sugar together in a large saucepan over a medium–low heat until the sugar has just dissolved. Stir in the vegan condensed milk and maple syrup and bring to the boil, stirring constantly for 5 minutes until thickened. Pour over the cooled shortbread. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until set before starting to make the chocolate layer.</li>
        <li>To make the topping, melt the chocolate and coconut oil in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (ensure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water), stirring occasionally. When smooth and glossy, pour over the set caramel layer and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Before cutting the shortbread, heat a knife in a bowl of hot water to avoid cracking the chocolate layer. First score the top, then slice through the layers. Finish with the pinch of sea salt and enjoy. Keep refrigerated to prevent the caramel from softening.</li>
    </ol>
