<h2>Description</h2>
<p>We've done it! We've created the perfect, fudgy, rich vegan brownie recipe. Add a fistful of vegan chocolate chips to make your brownies extra decadent. </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 tbsp ground flaxseed</li>
    <li>200g/7oz vegan dark chocolate, chopped</li>
    <li>175g/6oz dairy-free margarine</li>
    <li>125g/4½oz caster sugar</li>
    <li>125g/4½oz light muscovado sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp maple syrup or barley malt extract</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>150g/5½oz plain flour</li>
    <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>pinch salt</li>
    <li>2 tbsp soya milk</li>
    <li>100g/3½oz vegan chocolate chips (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3. Grease a 20 x 30cm/8 x 12in baking tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine the ground flaxseed with 9 tablespoons cold water and whisk together. Set aside for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water – do not allow the bowl to come into contact with the water. When almost all of the chocolate has melted, add the dairy-free margarine and remove the bowl from the heat to allow the margarine to melt into the chocolate.</li>
    <li>Add both types of sugar to the chocolate along with the maple syrup and vanilla extract and mix until smooth. </li>
    <li>Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into the bowl, add the soaked flax seed and the milk and mix until thoroughly incorporated and the mixture is smooth. </li>
    <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared tin and spread level with the back of a spoon. Scatter with chocolate chips, if using, and bake on the middle shelf of the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until lightly risen and set – the middle might still be slightly soft but this is ok – the brownies will be fudgy.</li>
    <li>Leave the brownies to cool completely in the tin, then transfer to a board and cut into squares.</li>
